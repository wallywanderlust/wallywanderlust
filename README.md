- 👋 Hi, I’m Walter Hampton. I'm 31 years old and a budding data analyst. I've been learning and doing projects 25 hours a week to learn more about data analytics and break into
the career.

- 👀 I’m interested in sports analytics and natural language processing. I speak English, German, French and Spanish and love to learn both about sports and languages. I also
love traveling! I am always doing some project and enjoy the process of learning.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about machine learning and natural language processing. I've done projects to see if I can predict player's salaries in the NBA and to create a user profile of individual drugs. I hope to be
doing a project soon on natural language processing.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that pertain to my interests!
